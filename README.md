This webpage aims to be a helpful resource for players of a mobile game called Orna. It focuses on mechanics of the game that are not demonstrated in a large amount of detail, and allows for people to use helpful calculators and guides to extend their play.


For changes on this page, I made the main page compile and updated descriptions on the main page such that it makes more sense.
